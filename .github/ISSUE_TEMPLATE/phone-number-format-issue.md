**For any phone number format-related issues (such as cannot detect a certain phone number) these items must be provided are required**

1. Real sample input (dummy phone number is fine, don't leave personal info)
2. Expected output
3. Reference docs/website showing that the phone number format should be valid, government websites, 3rd party websites, or even Wikipedia pages are fine.
4. **Make sure your reported phone number is a mobile phone number - landline, VoIP, or any other phone number formats are not supported**

**Creating a PR directly instead of creating an issue is much appreciated, thank you very much**
