## These items must be provided

1. Real sample input (dummy phone number is fine, don't leave personal info)
2. Expected output
3. Reference docs/website showing that the phone number format should be valid, government websites, 3rd party websites, or even Wikipedia pages are fine.

## Important notes
- Make sure your reported phone number is a mobile phone number - landline, VoIP, or any other phone number formats are not supported
- Creating a PR directly instead of creating an issue is much appreciated, thank you very much
